# Google Search Result Web-Crawler

### A web-crawler that can download Google search results as PDF files in your computer

## Task
Build a web-crawler that can search and download any articles people are interested in as PDF files to a specific directory.  
For example, people can enter "Pokemon Go" as the topic and "/Users/xxx/desktop" as the directory, and then the articles related to Pokemon Go will be saved at their desktop.

### Run Locally
* Run this Command: git clone <https://github.com/b05702057/Google-Search-Result-Web-Crawler.git>
* Change directory to the where the file "main.py" is saved
* Install all the toolkits used in this project

### Note
The search engine of Google is constantly revised, and this may cause the web-crawler to break down.  
If the situation happens, please notify me, so I will be able to fix the problems as soon as possible.
